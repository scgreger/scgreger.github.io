			<summary>"Quantum computing is an emergent field of computer science and engineering that harnesses the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers."</summary>

			<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-quantum-computing">McKinsey & Company explain what and why use a quantum computer</a>
			<summary>"Quantum computing is a new approach to calculation that uses principles of fundamental physics to solve extremely complex problems very quickly."</summary>

			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3fz3dqhN44">Video of Cleo Abram and Marques Brownly touring an IBM quantum lab</a>
			<summary>"Marques and I both realized quantum computing was this big important technology… that we didn’t really understand. So we decided to go on an adventure to learn the truth about quantum computers. And we're taking you with us, to show you what we learn as we learn it. But more importantly, to show you how these crazy computers might actually impact YOUR life... sooner than you think."</summary>
